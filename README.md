# Analyze-AB-Test-Results
Third project in Udacity Data Analyst NanoDegree

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. For this project, I will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. My goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should:
1. Implement the new webpage,
2. Keep the old webpage, or
3. Perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision
